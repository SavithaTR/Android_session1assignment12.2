A. What are the assumptions of ANOVA, test it out?
Ans: Assumptions
       Each group sample is drawn from a normally distributed population
       All populations have a common variance
       All samples are drawn independently of each other
       Within each sample, the observations are sampled randomly and independently of each other
        Factor effects are additive
library(mvoutlier)
outliers <- 
aq.plot(mtcars[c("mpg","disp","hp","drat","wt","qsec")])
mshapiro.test(M)
x <- as.matrix(mydata) 
center <- colMeans(x) 
n <- nrow(x); p <- ncol(x); cov <- cov(x); 
d <- mahalanobis(x,center,cov) 
qqplot(qchisq(ppoints(n),df=p),d,
  main="QQ Plot Assessing Multivariate Normality",
  ylab="Mahalanobis D2")
abline(a=0,b=1)


b. Why ANOVA test? Is there any other way to answer the above question?
Ans: ANOVA designs in traditional statistical packages, you are likely to find R's approach less coherent and user-friendly.
fit1<- lm(response ~ stimulus + condition + stimulus:condition, data=scrd) 
fit2<- lm(response ~ stimulus + condition, data=scrd) 
fit3<- lm(response ~ condition, data=scrd) 
op = par(mfrow=c(2,3)) 
hist(residuals(fit1)) 
hist(residuals(fit2)) 
hist(residuals(fit3))
qqnorm(residuals(fit1)) 
qqnorm(residuals(fit2)) 
qqnorm(residuals(fit3))
